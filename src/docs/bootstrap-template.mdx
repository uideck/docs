This document covers the installation and use of a Bootstrap HTML template and reveals answers to common problems and issues. If you have any question that is beyond the scope of this documentation, feel free to [Open a Support Ticket](https://uideck.com/support/) We will get back to you ASAP.

## Installing Template

After unzip/extract the download pack, you'll found a Template Folder with all the files you will need. Then

- You can view this template in any browser, you can see or edit the template without an internet connection.
- Now got to your cPanel or open your FTP client (like Filezilla) and upload the content of the template on your server root.
- Once the files are done uploading go to yourdomainname.com/index.html

#### Directory Structure

Here is the structure of download folder.

```
|-- Template Folder
    |-- assets
    |    |-- css
    |       |-- All CSS Files
    |    |-- scss
    |       |-- All SCSS Files
    |    |-- js
    |       |-- All JS Files

```

## Customization

#### Changing Default Theme Color

If template default color is `#4E6EF1` . Open `assets->css>main.css` file and and find out all `#4E6EF1` then replace it with your own color code, to change the color preset

** Note: ** If you are familiar with `scss` you can go with scss variables.

#### Changing Default Font Family

If default Font is `Josefin Sans` . Open `assets->css>main.css` file and and find out all font-family then replace its property with your own, to change the default font-family. But, make sure you have including the font before on header (using CSS link) or on CSS (using import)

** Note: ** If you are familiar with `scss` you can go with scss variables.

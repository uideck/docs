## Using PHP Contact Form
For Bootstrap templates, we used to provide a PHP script that only can be used for PHP servers if phpmailer function is up and running smoothly. Here is how it works:
Just **replace the email address with your own** from 

```
assets->php>contact.php
```
This procedure should work if everything is configured properly in the server-side.

## Using endpoint. Universal serverless and simple (Recommended)
We highly recommend, using a serverless end-point to make contact form dynamic. Since most of the users nowadays don't use PHP servers we developed a universal form API that works with all platforms and hosting.

```
<form
  action="https://formbold.com/s/unique_form_id" method="POST">

     <input type="email" placeholder="email" name="email">
     <input type="text" placeholder="subject" name="subject">
     <textarea name="message" placeholder="message"></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

Here all you need to **copy-paste the endpoint URL** that you will get when you join [FormBold](https://formbold.com)
Your form will become dynamic immediately and you can receive submissions to multiple channels including emails.

## Introduction

We use plain HTML and TailwindCSS to create static TailwindCSS templates, and few vanilla JS plugins for interaction (like slider, video and image popup).

## Directory Structure

Here is the structure of download folder.

```
|-- Template Folder
    |-- src
    |    |-- css
    |       |-- All CSS Files
    |    |-- js
    |       |-- All JS Files
    |    |-- images
    |       |-- All Images
    |    |-- partials
    |       |-- HTML Common Sections Like Header, Footer etc
    |    |-- index.html and All HTML Pages Files
    |
    |
    |-- All Config files
```

If you want to customize template just go with `src` folder here you will get all files.

## Installation

As we need to install our dependencies we need to have NODEJS installed in our machine. Then we can install via run the command below after the downloading file.

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the packages you can view the template in any browser or edit the template by using the dev version to use the dev version just give this command in project root. And then it will automatically open  localhost:3000 in your default browser

```bash
npm start
```

## Deploying to server

To deploy your template on the internet you have to run the command below, and then you have to just upload the `build` folder to your server.

```bash
npm run build
```

If you are using github repo then you can go with free of cost and easy to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Dark-Light Mode Settings
Some of our Tailwind templates has dark mode switcher, here is how you can switch your entire template into to single mode (dark or light)

### Light mode
If you want to use template Light version permanently, you need to just update the ***body tag of All Pages x-data={'darkMode': false}***. 

### Dark mode
If you want to make dark-mode default, you need to just update the ***body tag of All Pages x-data={'darkMode': true}***. 

And don't forget to remove the toggle button from html files.
